# FoodRunner
FoodRunner is a fully functional android application whose functionality is somewhat similar to food ordering applications such as Swiggy/Zomato.
### Abstract
Here, I have build a food ordering application with all the required functionalities. The application is able to fetch the list of all restaurants from the internet. However, the name of restaurants or dishes availabe are just for show and do not have any actual presence. I used Android Studio to develop this project.
